The only one thing that you are blindingly signing 
is cooperation in war against the IP laws and patents.
You can call this license GDGFL or GDGFAIPL but the main point 
is that if you use this software and or clone or read this repo you are joining into a clan of people 
who are against Intellectual Property ownership and patents in general. 


This planet Earth would be far more advanced if there wasn't IP laws and patent ownership 
which only benefits the lawyers and rich corporations USE GPLv3 or GDGFAIPL licence 
use any licence that forbids corporations to embeed the FLOSS code into their own products. 
And of course support FSF.org and FSFE.org
